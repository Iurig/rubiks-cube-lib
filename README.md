A Rust library that models the 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube and solves it the way a person would, one
named step at a time. It has one solving method, Roux. More methods and other cube types are
planned.

A cube state is a value of type `Cube3x3`. Moves are cube states too, and applying a move is just
group multiplication. Everything is `Copy`, and most operations are `const fn`,
so the entire move table is built at compile time.

> **Status: early work in progress.** The core group structure and every move in standard
> notation (faces, slices, rotations, wide moves) work and are tested against real
> reconstructions. The Roux solver works, and its public API is still changing.
> See [Current state](#current-state).

## Quick example

```rust
use rubiks_cube_lib::{Cube3x3, Inv, Pow, Puzzle};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Apply a sequence to the solved cube, example is Sebastiano Tronto's 16 move FMC WR
    let scramble = Cube3x3::from_solved("R' U' F D2 L2 F R2 U2 R2 B D2 L B2 D' B2 L' R' B D2 B U2 L U2 R' U' F")?;
    let solution = Cube3x3::from_solved("D2 F' D2 U2 F' L2 D R2 D B2 F L2 R' F' D U'")?;

    // Composition is multiplication: left operand first, then right
    assert!((scramble * solution).is_solved());

    // Inverses and powers
    assert_eq!(Cube3x3::from_solved("R")?.inverse(), Cube3x3::from_solved("R'")?);
    assert!(Cube3x3::from_solved("R U R' U'")?.pow(6).is_solved());

    // Chain moves onto an existing state
    let cube = Cube3x3::IDENTITY.move_sequence("R U")?.move_sequence("R' U'")?;
    assert_eq!(cube, Cube3x3::from_solved("R U R' U'")?);

    // Unknown tokens are errors, not panics
    assert!(Cube3x3::from_solved("R Q U").is_err());
    Ok(())
}
```

## Notation

Move strings use standard cube notation. Whitespace and newlines separate moves, and anything
after `//` on a line is a comment, so you can paste annotated reconstructions directly:

```rust
let solved = rubiks_cube_lib::Cube3x3::from_solved("
    U' L2 D' B2 D R2 F2 D' B2 R2 D B' R F2 R D' B' F U2 R' U D   // scramble
    y2 F' M F' R U' R U' Fw z'                                  // FB
    U R U r M' U' R U2' R'                                      // SS
    ...
");
```

| Kind        | Tokens                       | Implemented           |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Face turns  | `R` `L` `U` `D` `F` `B`      | Yes                   |
| Slice moves | `M` `E` `S`                  | Yes                   |
| Rotations   | `x` `y` `z`                  | Yes                   |
| Wide moves  | `Rw` … or lowercase `r` …    | Yes                   |

All these work with the following 4 modifiers: ` `(none), `'`, `2` and `2'`

A lowercase face letter (`r`, `l`, `u`, `d`, `f`, `b`) is the wide move of that face, so `r` and
`Rw` are the same move. Every token goes through the same path, so a lone `r` or a line that is
only a comment behaves the same as it would inside a longer sequence. A string with no moves in it, such as an empty string or
a comment on its own, leaves the cube unchanged. A token that is not a move makes the whole call
return an `Err` naming that token.

## Solving

`Method::roux` builds the Roux method from a `RouxOptions`. `solve` runs the method's steps in
order and returns a `Solution`, with one segment per step:

```rust
use rubiks_cube_lib::{Cube3x3, Method, Puzzle, RouxOptions};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let scramble = "D2 F2 R2 U L2 D R2 U' B2 L2 B L2 F' L D2 U R' B D2";
    let roux = Method::roux(RouxOptions::default());

    let mut cube = Cube3x3::from_solved(scramble)?;
    let solution = roux.solve(&mut cube)?;
    assert!(cube.is_solved());

    // A printed solution is notation, so the scramble followed by it replays to solved.
    let replayed = Cube3x3::from_solved(scramble)?.move_sequence(&solution.to_string())?;
    assert!(replayed.is_solved());

    // The same solve, one step per `next()`.
    let mut cube = Cube3x3::from_solved(scramble)?;
    for segment in roux.solve_steps(&mut cube) {
        print!("{}", segment?);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

A printed solution has one line per step: the moves, then `//` and the step's name. One run of
[examples/main.rs](examples/main.rs) printed this for the scramble above:

```text
F' Uw2 Rw Fw M' E' F2	//FB
U Rw2 U M' U2 Rw' U Rw2 U R	//SB
Rw' D' Rw U Rw' D Rw U' Rw U Rw' U'	//CMLL
M U M2 U2 M U' M2 U' M U' M'	//LSE
```

`RouxOptions` switches the first and second blocks between one search and a square plus a
pair, and the last-layer corners between one algorithm and two. With a split block the solver
tries both the front and the back square and keeps the shorter.

A method is a list of steps. The crate has two step types: `SearchStep`, which searches for a
goal within a fixed set of moves or algorithms, and `Choose`, which keeps the shortest of
several steps. Any type that implements the `Step` trait can join them. The
[API documentation](#api-documentation) describes each type.

`cargo bench --bench solves` times two passes of 1000 seeded Roux solves and reports time,
moves, and heap use per step.

## How it works

The cube is the direct product of three independent piece groups:

- **Centers**: 6 pieces, no orientation. Only slice moves and rotations move them. The other pieces are expressed as if these were not moved (i.e. moves that move them will be translated to face turns).
- **Corners**: 8 pieces, orientation in ℤ/3ℤ.
- **Edges**: 12 pieces, orientation in ℤ/2ℤ.

Each is a `PieceConfiguration<P, N, O>`: a permutation array of `N` pieces of type `P` plus an
orientation array of `N` values in `Zn<O>`. Composition (`then`) permutes and adds orientations;
inversion negates them. `Cube3x3` just composes its three configurations component-wise.

Piece types are fieldless `#[repr(u8)]` enums implementing the `Piece` trait, which lets the
library index arrays by piece at zero cost (a compile-time assertion checks that each enum's
discriminants match its `ALL` order). Ordering conventions follow blindfolded-solving
standard memorization order, except for edges which are clockwise by layer, starting on the last and going to the first:

- Centers: `U F R B L D`
- Corners: `UBL UBR UFR UFL DFL DFR DBR DBL`
- Edges: `UB UR UF UL FL FR BR BL DF DR DB DL`

Corner orientation counts clockwise twists relative to the U/D sticker being in the U or D layer; edge orientation is 0 for
oriented, 1 for flipped.

`Cube3x3` implements `Display` as the unfolded sticker net, each facelet lettered by the face its
sticker belongs to when solved (`println!("{cube}")`); `cube.facelets()` gives the same data as a
`Facelets` value with a `face(Center)` accessor. This is the debugging view: it shows what a
physical cube would look like, so a wrong twist or flip convention is visible at a glance.

Only the nine base moves (six faces, three slices) are written by hand, as explicit cycles in
[src/cube3by3/moves/table.rs](src/cube3by3/moves/table.rs). Rotations (`x = R M' L'`,
`y = U E' D'`, `z = F S B'`), wide moves (a face turn followed by its parallel slice), and every
inverse and double are derived from those nine at compile time into a single `ALL_MOVES` table
that string parsing looks up. A derived move therefore cannot drift from its base moves.

## API documentation

Every public item has a doc comment. Build and open the documentation with:

```sh
cargo doc --open
```

The main entry points:

- **`Cube3x3`** is a cube state. `from_solved` and `move_sequence` apply notation, `*` composes
  states, and `corners()`, `edges()`, and `centers()` give the pieces for queries such as
  `piece_at`.
- **`Puzzle`** is the trait the solver works through. Import it to call `is_solved` or
  `random_state_with_seed`.
- **`Method`** runs a list of steps. `Method::roux` builds Roux, and `solve` or `solve_steps`
  runs it.
- **`Step`**, **`SearchStep`**, and **`Choose`** are the steps a method is built from, and
  **`Mask`** says what a step needs and what it solves.
- **`Solution`**, **`StepError`**, and **`SolveError`** are what a solve returns.

## Building and testing

Requires a Rust toolchain with the 2024 edition (Rust 1.85 or newer). The library depends on
`fastrand` for random cube states, and no public function takes or returns a `fastrand` type.
It also depends on `log`, through which the solver reports each step at the `debug` level. It
never prints.

```sh
cargo build
cargo test
cargo bench --bench solves
RUST_LOG=rubiks_cube_lib=debug cargo run --example main
```

## Current state

All unit, integration, and doc tests pass; none are `#[ignore]`d.

What works today:

- All six face turns, the three slice moves `M`, `E`, `S`, the three rotations `x`, `y`, `z`,
  and the six wide moves `Rw` ... `Bw` (also as lowercase `r` ... `b`), each with the `'`, `2`,
  and `2'` modifiers. Rotations and wide moves are derived at compile time from the face and
  slice moves, so they cannot drift out of sync with them. The base moves are pinned by
  handedness tests, and the whole notation is exercised by CFOP and Roux reconstructions.
- Move strings return `Result`: an unknown token is an `Err` naming it, never a panic.
- `is_solved` is rotation-aware: it re-orients the cube by its centers before comparing with
  the identity, so `Cube3x3::from_solved("x y2 z'")` reports solved.
- A cube state can be queried: `cube.corners().piece_at(Corner::Ubr)` says which piece sits in
  the UBR slot, and `orientation_at` reads its twist or flip. The handedness tests are written
  against these queries, from outside the crate.
- `is_reachable` checks the twist, flip, and permutation-parity invariants, plus that the centers
  form a whole-cube rotation, so a state no move sequence can produce is rejected.
- The Roux solver works with every combination of its options. A test runs all eight
  combinations on four seeded random scrambles and replays each solution, and the benchmark
  solves 2000 more.
- A solve fails with a typed error that names the step: the step's own `StepError`, or
  `NotDone` when the step returned without meeting its goal.
- A method can mix step types, and `Choose` picks between alternatives by move count.

## Roadmap

- Fingertrick-aware output. A solution already prints as notation; this is why `2'` is kept
  distinct from `2` in the `Move` label even though they share a cube state.
- Build a step's moveset from notation text, so each step can use its own moves. Today the
  first-block steps search with every move the cube has.
- More methods (CFOP, ZZ, Petrus) and a command-line solver that prints a reconstruction.
- Reuse `PieceConfiguration` / `Piece` for other puzzles.
