/// A twisty puzzle the solver can work on. [`Cube3x3`](crate::Cube3x3) is the only one so far.

/// Import this trait to call its methods on a cube, such as [`is_solved`](Puzzle::is_solved).
/// A puzzle state is a value; applying a move with `*` returns the new state.
///
/// # Laws
///
/// Generic code, such as a [`Mask`](crate::Mask), relies on every implementation keeping these:
///
/// 1. `Self::default()` is the solved state, and the identity for moves.
/// 2. A move acts the same way on every state. For any state `p`, move `m`, and slot `s`, let
///    `action = Self::default() * m` and `src = action.piece_at(s)`, the slot `m` moves into `s`.
///    Then `(p * m).piece_at(s) == p.piece_at(src)`, and `(p * m).orientation_at(s) ==
///    p.orientation_at(src) + action.orientation_at(s)`.
///
/// So reading `piece_at` and `orientation_at` at every slot of `Self::default() * m` gives
/// everything `m` does to any state.
